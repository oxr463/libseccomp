NAME
====

seccomp_release - Release the seccomp filter state

SYNOPSIS
========

    #include <seccomp.h>

    typedef void * scmp_filter_ctx;

    void seccomp_release(scmp_filter_ctx ctx);

    Link with -lseccomp.

DESCRIPTION
===========

Releases the seccomp filter in *ctx* which was first initialized by
**seccomp_init**(3) or **seccomp_reset**(3) and frees any memory
associated with the given seccomp filter context. Any seccomp filters
loaded into the kernel are not affected.

RETURN VALUE
============

Does not return a value.

EXAMPLES
========

    #include <seccomp.h>

    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
    	int rc;
    	scmp_filter_ctx ctx;

    	ctx = seccomp_init(SCMP_ACT_KILL);
    	if (ctx == NULL)
    		return -1;

    	/* ... */

    	seccomp_release(ctx);
    	return 0;
    }

NOTES
=====

While the seccomp filter can be generated independent of the kernel,
kernel support is required to load and enforce the seccomp filter
generated by libseccomp.

The libseccomp project site, with more information and the source code
repository, can be found at https://github.com/seccomp/libseccomp. This
tool, as well as the libseccomp library, is currently under development,
please report any bugs at the project site or directly to the author.

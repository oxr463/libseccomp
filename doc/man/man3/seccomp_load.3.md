NAME
====

seccomp_load - Load the current seccomp filter into the kernel

SYNOPSIS
========

    #include <seccomp.h>

    typedef void * scmp_filter_ctx;

    int seccomp_load(scmp_filter_ctx ctx);

    Link with -lseccomp.

DESCRIPTION
===========

Loads the seccomp filter provided by *ctx* into the kernel; if the
function succeeds the new seccomp filter will be active when the
function returns.

As it is possible to have multiple stacked seccomp filters for a given
task (defined as either a process or a thread), it is important to
remember that each of the filters loaded for a given task are executed
when a syscall is made and the "strictest" rule is the rule that is
applied. In the case of seccomp, "strictest" is defined as the action
with the lowest value (e.g. *SCMP_ACT_KILL* is "stricter" than
*SCMP_ACT_ALLOW* ).

RETURN VALUE
============

Returns zero on success, negative errno values on failure.

EXAMPLES
========

    #include <seccomp.h>

    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
    	int rc = -1;
    	scmp_filter_ctx ctx;

    	ctx = seccomp_init(SCMP_ACT_KILL);
    	if (ctx == NULL)
    		goto out;

    	/* ... */

    	rc = seccomp_load(ctx);
    	if (rc < 0)
    		goto out;

    	/* ... */

    out:
    	seccomp_release(ctx);
    	return -rc;
    }

NOTES
=====

While the seccomp filter can be generated independent of the kernel,
kernel support is required to load and enforce the seccomp filter
generated by libseccomp.

repository, can be found at https://github.com/seccomp/libseccomp. This
tool, as well as the libseccomp library, is currently under development,
please report any bugs at the project site or directly to the author.
